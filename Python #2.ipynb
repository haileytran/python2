    "Python can also do that same sort of classfication using assignment statements. These statements assign variables to expressions. The variable name is simply to label the value of the expression. The syntax is as followed `variable = expression`. Python will evaluate the expression on the right side of the `=` and then store it to the variable on the left of the `=`. Everytime you call that varible in your code now, Python will insert the evaluated expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "1. Variables cannot start with a number like `4` but, `four` will work.\n",
    "2. Variables are case senstive, meaning `tiger` is different from `Tiger`.\n",
